# 🖐️ Finger Counting Game

This project is a fun little game I'm building to help my younger cousin learn addition. The idea is simple: the game shows a math problem, and you show the answer with your fingers to the camera.

It's a work in progress, born from a desire to make learning interactive and fun. For me, it's also an opportunity to dive into the world of computer vision and real-time image processing.

## 🚀 How It Works

The game uses your webcam to see your hand. It identifies the landmarks on your hand (like your knuckles and fingertips) to figure out how many fingers you're holding up.
